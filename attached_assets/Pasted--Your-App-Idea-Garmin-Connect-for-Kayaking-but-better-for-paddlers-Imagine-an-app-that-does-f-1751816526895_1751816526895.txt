🛶 Your App Idea: "Garmin Connect for Kayaking" (but better for paddlers)
Imagine an app that does for kayaking what Garmin Connect does for runners — but designed just for us.

🧠 What the app does (in simple terms):
✅ Track your sessions (distance, time, speed)
✅ Measure your heart rate during paddling
✅ Connect to a paddle power meter to get real power data
✅ Track your stroke rate (cadence)
✅ Estimate your VO₂ max from paddling
✅ Predict your race times (200m, 500m, 1000m)
✅ Give feedback like:

"You're improving your efficiency"

"You held high power for longer today"

"You're paddling more economically than last week"

📲 How the app works (behind the scenes):
You connect your sensors

Like a heart rate monitor or paddle power meter (via Bluetooth)

You go for a paddle

The app records speed, HR, power, and stroke rate

The app does the math

Calculates how much oxygen you’re probably using (VO₂ max)

Looks at how efficient you are (power vs heart rate)

Compares your effort to past workouts

You get useful insights

“Today’s session improved your 500m race prediction by 1.3 sec”

“Your power dropped less after 4 minutes — you're getting stronger”

🎯 What makes this different from Garmin?
Garmin Connect	Your Kayak App
Running/Cycling only	🚣‍♂️ Kayaking focused
Doesn’t track strokes	✅ Tracks stroke rate (cadence)
No paddle power	✅ Paddle power meter support
Wrong VO₂ max	✅ Real paddling VO₂ max
General training tips	✅ Kayak-specific insights

⚙️ Example features in plain English:
Session summary
“You paddled 8.4 km in 42 min at 180 bpm avg. Estimated VO₂: 54 ml/kg/min.”

Race predictor
“Based on your last week, we think you could paddle 1000m in 4:03.”

Efficiency tracker
“Your power per heartbeat has gone up 6% since last week — you're getting more efficient.”

Training zones
“You spent 12 minutes in zone 4 (threshold) today. Great endurance stimulus.”

📦 Optional extras (future ideas)
Technique analysis (using phone camera or IMUs)

Share sessions with teammates or coach

Competition leaderboard for training sprints

Weekly reports and progress charts
