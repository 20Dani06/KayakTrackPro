üõ∂ Adding Garmin File Upload to PaddleTracker
You have your kayaking fitness tracking app, PaddleTracker, and it already lets you manually enter session data (distance, duration, heart rate, stroke rate, power, etc.).

However, now you'd like to make things simpler and more automatic by uploading your kayaking session data directly from Garmin Connect.

üîπ Why this matters:
Right now, you have to manually type in your kayaking session details. Garmin already tracks all these details during your paddles, so being able to upload that file directly saves a ton of time and prevents mistakes.

üìÅ Step-by-Step Explanation of What You Want to Add:
Step 1: Exporting Garmin Files
After your kayaking session, your watch (or Garmin device) syncs with Garmin Connect automatically.

You then log into Garmin Connect on your computer (or phone), select the kayaking session, and download a FIT file.

A FIT file is basically a special file containing all your session data (distance, GPS coordinates, speed, heart rate, stroke rate, time, and more).

Step 2: Uploading FIT Files to PaddleTracker
You want to be able to go into PaddleTracker and click an "Upload Garmin Session" button.

When you click this, it opens a file picker window, allowing you to select the downloaded FIT file from your computer or mobile device.

Step 3: PaddleTracker Reads and Interprets the FIT File
Once you upload the FIT file, PaddleTracker should automatically read and extract all the details of your session.

This includes:

Date and time

Duration

Distance paddled

GPS location data (coordinates and route)

Speed and pace

Heart rate

Stroke rate (cadence)

Power data (if available)

PaddleTracker then saves this information as a session in its database, exactly as if you had manually entered it.

Step 4: Automatically Calculating Metrics (VO‚ÇÇ Max, Training Zones, Predictions)
PaddleTracker should automatically run its existing kayak-specific calculations (VO‚ÇÇ max estimation, training zones, race predictions) on the uploaded Garmin session data.

You don't have to manually trigger this‚Äîit should happen automatically.

üìä Step 5: Viewing Detailed Garmin Charts in PaddleTracker
Right now, in Garmin Connect, you see detailed charts like:

Speed over time

Heart rate graphs

Stroke rate and cadence charts

Power output graphs

Map of your paddling route

You want PaddleTracker to also display these detailed charts.
After uploading a FIT file, PaddleTracker should immediately let you view:

Graphs: Speed, heart rate, stroke rate, power, and pace over the whole paddle session.

Route Map: A visual map showing exactly where you paddled (using the GPS coordinates stored in the FIT file).

This means you can analyze your kayaking performance directly within PaddleTracker, without needing Garmin Connect again.
